# Backend API host URL
# ⚠️ PRODUCTION: Always use HTTPS (e.g., https://api.example.com)
# ❌ NEVER use HTTP in production - credentials will be exposed!
# 
# 💡 TIP: For local development, you can omit the scheme:
#   - localhost:19091 → automatically uses http://localhost:19091
#   - api.example.com → automatically uses https://api.example.com
# 
# Explicit scheme always takes precedence if provided.
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_HOST=

# ⚠️ SECURITY WARNING: NEXT_PUBLIC_* variables are exposed to the browser!
# Do not use this for storing actual secrets or authentication tokens.
# The current codebase uses this for legacy API access, but user authentication
# is handled via session-token stored in localStorage after login.
# 
# RECOMMENDATION: Backend should rely solely on session-token for authentication.
# This token should be deprecated or removed for better security.
